DESCRIPTION:
It is a graduation project that I developed on the Tkinter interface and openCV in Python, where there
are many different options and the desired one can be selected from the interface. As an
option, we can add filters to our webcam or manually increase and decrease the color
saturation, adjust the values such as contrast and brightness, and get the output we
want, Portrait mode takes the part of our face as a circle and blurs the rest, Real-time
face recognition option, on the selected photo face recognition option, the option to
record our face as a video with a webcam, the automatic brightness and contrast
optimization tool, a Photoshop-style simple interface tool that allows us to manually
manipulate the values of the photo and obtain the desired output, and also a tool that
allows us to manually optimize the video in real-time.
